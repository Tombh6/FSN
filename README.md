# FSN
Full Stack Final project

A web app that brings together news articles from around the world under one dashboard. The articles can be filtered, sorted and also searched. The application will be based on the News API, the server was built using Node.js technology and MongoDB was used.In addition, entity extraction is used which will extract specific entities in the text that we will focus on based on keywords. The model identifies key elements in the text and then classifies them into predefined categories and actually creates the hashtags that will appear above the article. Through this feature the user will be able to know what content will appear in the article and by doing so he will not have to enter the article itself but will be able to understand this through the keywords that will appear before it is opened.
